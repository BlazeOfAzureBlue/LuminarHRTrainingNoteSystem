# How to download

When you're first loading onto the git, you will see the fact that there is all the source code and releases. In order to download the actual application, on the sidebar will be **Releases.** Download the latest .exe version to run.

# How to use

## Adding new players

## Removing players
You can remove players who are no longer in the training by clicking on their name and clicking "Remove Selected"

This will clear all data of them from the application.

## Changing Scores

Click on the player in the list which you wish to change the values of.

Then, click the + / - icon next to the number value below the name of the value you wish to change. For example, in the below screenshot, I have set "Kitsune" to 3 kills:

## Understanding the leaderboard

The leaderboard will automatically change to reflect their current ranking in the training **overall.**

Those with the most kills and made retreats will rank first, followed by retreats then deaths then warnings. An example of this can be seen here:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3335edf9-6bc6-43a6-8b87-b8a1105ebc6d)

For what value means, it is as follows:
**K** - Kills
**D** - Deaths
**R** - Retreats
**M** - Made Retreats (Forced another player to retreat.)

**These values do not all need to be used if the training type does not require them.**

## Resetting current round values

When a round is over, you can press the "Reset Current Round" when the round is over.

Doing this will change the current K/D/R/M to 0 on each value whilst retaining the overall total for rankings. It will also reset the values you assign when + / -'ing values.

## Warnings

When someone has misbehaved during training, you can warn them by selecting their name in the list. Type in whatever warning message you wish to in the large box and click "Enter Warning for Selected".

This will add a warning next to their name and put a log of it in the large box at the bottom.

## Removing warnings
If you incorrectly warned someone, you can remove their warning by selecting their name in the list and clicking "Remove Warning from Selected". This will remove their warning and add a log that you removed it.

## Notes

You can add a note to yourself by following the same process as above but you do not need to select a name (if you have a name selected, it does not matter.) You then click "Add Personal Note".

Doing so will add a note in the logs system.
